# Machine Learning Tutorial: Predicting the World Cup #

*Sorin Peste (sorinpeste@gmail.com)*

## Intro ##

This is a tutorial on using Machine Learning while trying to predict who is going to win the next [FIFA World Cup](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/index.html).

We're going to use historical information about international football (soccer) matches to build a model, which is going to give us the ability to predict future match results.

Afterwards, we're going to use that model to run multiple simulations of the next World Cup tournament, and produce statistics about which teams are the most likely to win it all.

This tutorial is meant for people who are new to Machine Learning, and want to better understand the data science process, as well as the R language.
